## Tech Stack
Expo + FireBase

### Setup
1. Clone the Repository
2. Run the typical ```npm install```
3. cd to trash-to-treasures, then ```npx expo start```
4. For file uploads in dev, Google Cloud SDK is needed


### Current Work (updated Jan 27)
1. the login with email/password with authentication functionality is working with FireBase
2. frontend looks ugly
3. backend initial setup with firebase is done. will implment FireBase Admin services directly to the backend

### What's left for now
1. allowing a user to upload an item to the database (text info, photo, etc.)
2. a grid-like format to show uploaded items within the database after logging in
